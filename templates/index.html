        Currently, the page is still under development.
        I don't treat it exclusively as a platform for writing on work-related

        So, stay tuned and keep exploring!

        <li>Cookies? - No, thank you. I'm on a diet.</li>

            If you'd like to introduce yourself, go and write to me!

        <li>A ton of JavaScript? - No, I try my best to follow
